so it is currently 00:02 as i am writing this, 02/18/26. i have a chemistry test today and it would really help if i remembered the reactions from the pdf cuz that's the topic n all. so i thought Why not just test myself by making like a bunch of questions about this and of course i used C++ becaus it 's my favourite language lol.
anyways this took forever to finish, i actually created a folder of this name ("chem but cpp") on my laptop at 21:16, and around that time is when i started working on this thing i guess so lol. Worth it? well it certainly was an experience and a half, i mean, hey, i get to review before the test on the school computer hehe :3

Code finished on 02/17/26 at 23:56 xd
